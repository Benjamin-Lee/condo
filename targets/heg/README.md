# HEG CUB Data

The data for highly expressed genes (HEGs) was automatically downloaded from
[HEG-DB](http://genomes.urv.cat/HEG-DB/). At the time of this writing (8/1/18),
it does not appear that the database is being updated. The code to retrieve the
HEG FASTA files is available [here](targets/heg/Download HEG.ipynb).
